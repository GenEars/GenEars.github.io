## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="me.jpg">

Welcome to my personal page.
You'll find here some elements about my professional activities and hobbies!

I am a research engineer in the INNOV/DATA-AI department at [Orange Labs Chatillon](https://hellofuture.orange.com/fr/).
My research is about **knowledge engineering** and **dependability**.
Linked to this, I'm interrested in,
* Distributed and dynamic systems,
* Datascience and graph theory,
* Coding schemes and high-perf computing.

I hold a Master degree in *telecommunications technologies* from the [Conservatoire National des Arts & Métiers](http://www.cnam.fr/) (CNAM).

I am currently a PhD candidate supervised by Dr. [Yoan Chabot](https://yoanchabot.github.io/) and Dr. [Raphaël Troncy](https://www.eurecom.fr/~troncy/).
My work is focused on the synergy of symbolic and probabilistic reasoning to facilitate the analysis of incidents in the field of network operations and cybersecurity (thesis subject [here](http://www.theses.fr/s278014) and [here](https://myedb.edite-de-paris.fr/PRD_View/8053/)).

Enjoy your visit!
