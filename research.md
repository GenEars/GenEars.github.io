### Current projects

Orange:

* Synergy between knowledge graphs and machine learning for the detection of anomalies.  
  
  Related on-line resources,
  * *[NORIA-O](https://w3id.org/noria/)*, a RDF a data model for IT networks, events and operations information. 
  * *[Dynagraph](https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/dynagraph)*, network dumping and Web app for live 3D graph rendering of streamed graph data derived from traces.
  * *[grlc](https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/grlc)*, a fork of [CLARIAH/grlc](https://github.com/CLARIAH/grlc) with SPARQL UPDATE and GitLab interface features.
  * *[SMASSIF-RML](https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/SMASSIF-RML)*, a Semantic Web stream processing solution with declarative data mapping capability based on a modified version of the [RMLMapper-java](https://github.com/RMLio/rmlmapper-java) tool and extensions to the [StreamingMASSIF](https://github.com/IBCNServices/StreamingMASSIF) framework.
  * *[ssb-consum-up](https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/ssb-consum-up)*, a Kafka to SPARQL gateway enabling end-to-end Semantic Web data flow architecture with a Semantic Service Bus (SSB) approach.
  * *[SemNIDS](https://github.com/D2KLab/SemNIDS)*, bringing semantics into Network Intrusion Detection Systems.  

### Past projects

Orange:

* Merging graphs and time-series techniques to predict network issues and reduce the root-cause search space,
* Knowledge and process mining on network issues remediation to facilitate root-cause analysis and remediation automation,
* Automating the resilience tests of an IP-MPLS backbone.
